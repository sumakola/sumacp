# Write the function pascalsTriangleValue(row, col)
# that takes int values row and col, and returns the
# value in the given row and column of Pascal's
# Triangle where the triangle starts at row 0, and
# each row starts at column 0. If either row or col
# are not legal values, return None, instead of crashing.
