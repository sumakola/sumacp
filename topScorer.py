# topScorer(data) [10 Points]
# Write the function topScorer(data) that takes a multi-line
# string encoding scores as csv data for some kind of
# competition with players receiving scores, so each
# line has comma-separated values. The first value on
# each line is the name of the player (which you can
# assume has no integers in it), and each value after
# that is an individual score (which you can assume is a
# non-negative integer). You should add all the scores
# for that player, and then return the player with the
# highest total score. If there is a tie, return all the
# tied players in a comma-separated string with the names
# in the same order they appeared in the original data.
# If nobody wins (there is no data), return None (not the
# string "None"). So, for example:

# reference from
def topScorer(data):
    # Your code goes here...
    if(data == ""):
        return None

    b = []
    spData = data.split("\n")
    for i in range(len(spData) - 1):
        a.append(spData[i].split(","))
    for i in range(len(a)):
        b.append(a[i][0])
        del a[i][0]
    x = max(a[0])
    y = max(a[1])
    if x > y:
        return b[0]
    elif y > x:
        return b[1]
    else:
        seperator = ','
        res = (str(seperator.join(b)))
